In the wake of the Cultural Revolution and now of the recession I
observe a mounting pressure to co-operate and to promote "teamwork". For
its anti-individualistic streak, such a drive is of course highly
suspect; some people may not be so sensitive to it, but having seen the
Hitlerjugend in action suffices for the rest of your life to be very
wary of "team spirit". Very.
